# LEOQUEST

Implementing a project with many participants often takes a lot of time. Sometimes it would be practical to create an online survey quickly instead of finding out who is available when or how someone thinks about a topic with a lot of phone calls and emails. Creating a survey online isn't just for pollsters. Most of us are familiar with online questionnaires in which the various options are simply clicked on in the browser. With Leo-quest you can create an online survey in a similar way.
